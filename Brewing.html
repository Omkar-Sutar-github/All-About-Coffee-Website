	<h1>Making coffee</h1>
	<h2>Brewing:</h2>

	<p>
		 These days, with so many different ways to make coffee at home, you can feel overwhelmed even before you begin. We’re here to make it simpler for you. From our mainstay, the pour over, to the esoteric siphon pot, we’ll break down the different ways to make coffee, highlighting the qualities in each finished cup and the technical chops each method requires. By identifying the kind of coffee that you’re after and how much work you’re willing to do, you’ll be able to navigate your way to your preferred brew method.
	</p>
	<h3>There are many brewing methods</h3>

	</ul>
	 

      <h3 id="Pourover">Pour Over Method</h3>
	<p>
		The pour over method produces coffee with a delicate and smooth texture that resides somewhere between juicy and tea-like. A pour over coffee’s flavor is often at its most expressive, partly due to the filtration, which adds polish and clarity to the cup, and partly due to the amount of water used in relation to the ground coffee. 
	</p>

	  
       <h3 id="Coffeemaker">Coffeemaker method</h3>
	<p>
		Depends on the machine, but its anatomy is similar to a pour over dripper. A conical filter sits above a pot. Place a paper filter (unless the device has a built-in reusable filter), fill it with ground coffee, and press “start.” Like a pour over, the paper filter results in a clarified mouthfeel.
		
	</p>
	  <h3 id="French-Press">French-Press method</h3>
	  <p>
	  	French press is an immersion brew method, meaning coffee grounds are fully immersed in water and then strained using a metal filter. Metal filters allow oils and undissolved coffee particles to pass into the cup.
